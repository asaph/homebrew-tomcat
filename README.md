homebrew-tomcat
===============

Homebrew tap for Apache Tomcat supporting advanced configuration including SSL, APR, gzip and more

Usage:

- Backup any existing configuration or webapps in your existing brewed tomcat as these will be deleted shortly. (Skip this step if brewed tomcat isn't installed)
- Shutdown your existing brewed tomcat. (Skip this step if brewed tomcat isn't running) 

    catalina stop

- Delete your existing brewed tomcat

    brew rm tomcat

- Tap this repo:

    brew tap asaph/tomcat

You'll see this warning which is safe to ignore. It just means you'll have to qualify the tomcat formula name when referencing it

    Warning: Could not tap asaph/tomcat/tomcat over Homebrew/homebrew/tomcat

- Install tomcat with APR, SSL and gzip compression

    brew install --with-apr --with-ssl --with-compression asaph/tomcat/tomcat

- Start tomcat

    catalina start

- To validate tomcat is working, point your browser to http://localhost:8080/

- To validate https is working, point your browser to https://localhost:8443/

That's it! To see all available options:

    brew options asaph/tomcat/tomcat

homebrew-tomcat
===============

Homebrew tap for Apache Tomcat supporting advanced configuration including SSL, APR, gzip and more.

**Note: The tomcat formula included in this tap will generate self-signed SSL certs which are suitable for development use only.
Production sites should swap out the self-signed SSL certs generated by this tap for real ones purchased from a trusted vendor.**

Usage:
-

1. Backup any existing configuration or webapps in your existing brewed tomcat as these will be deleted shortly. (Skip this step if brewed tomcat isn't installed)
2. Shutdown your existing brewed tomcat. (Skip this step if brewed tomcat isn't running) 

    `catalina stop`

3. Delete your existing brewed tomcat. (Skip this step if brewed tomcat isn't installed)

    `brew rm tomcat`

4. Tap this repo:

    `brew tap asaph/tomcat`

    You'll see this warning which is safe to ignore. It just means you'll have to qualify the tomcat formula name when referencing it

    `Warning: Could not tap asaph/tomcat/tomcat over Homebrew/homebrew/tomcat`

5. Install tomcat 8 with APR, SSL and gzip compression:

    `brew install --with-apr --with-ssl --with-compression asaph/tomcat/tomcat`

    or if installing tomcat 7:

    `brew install --with-apr --with-ssl --with-compression asaph/tomcat/tomcat7`

6. Start tomcat

    `catalina start`

7. To validate tomcat is working, point your browser to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

8. To validate https is working, point your browser to [https://localhost:8443/](https://localhost:8443/).
